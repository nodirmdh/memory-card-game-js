A simple memory game in JavaScript

I just wanted to how to use (Vanilla) JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements. I practiced more and had fun while developing a game.

Do you remember that game called Memory that you used to play with the actual paper cards? To win, you needed to memorize the position of the paired card.

The game consists of an even number of cards with a specific image on one side and a generic blue background on the other side.
Each image appears on two cards.
The game rules:

When the game starts, all cards are turned face down.
The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them.
If the selected two cards have the same image, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a short time.
The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face-up in the least number of tries.


Controls
The player can click his/her mouse to turn their card.
